			<h2>Courses at The Stained Glass Works </h2>
			<p> Our courses cover all the practical and aesthetic aspects of creating works in Leadlight, Copper Foil and Kilnwork.

				Each course uses the tools, equipment, techniques and skills required to accomplish the work.

				Our expert teachers include important related subjects such as safety precautions and workshop layout.

				The Stained Glass Works studio is specifically designed for teaching. It houses three large light tables, glass grinders, drawing materials, soldering irons, design books and storage facilities.</p>
				
			<h2> Leadlight </h2>
			<p> Students who attend this course will design and create their own leadlight panels or, after some experience, tiffany style lamp shades.

				Classes cover the technical considerations of designing and cutting glass for leadlight and how to select and cut lead into the various angles required to join the glass to its maximum strength.

				Upon completion of leading process, students will be taught how to solder panels. The final process involves waterproofing the window and blackening the lead. Installation will also be covered during this course.</p>
				<h2> Copper Foil </h2>

				<p> Instruction is available for those students who wish to explore this medium.</p>



				<h2> Kiln Work </h2>

				<p> Students who attend this course will complete a number of dimensional glass pieces of their own design. Such articles as platters, bowls, vases and ornamental objects are explored in these classes.

				Kiln maintenance and hot glass safety precautions are also addressed in detail.

				Students will gain some understanding of how to test glass for compatibility using a stressometer. Upon establishing a suitable combination of glasses, students will then use draping or slumping techniques to form their glassware.

				Prior to shaping the glass the students will be shown how to prepare the various mould surfaces. Although some students will know how to cut glass, instruction will also be given in this area.</p>



				<h2> Fees </h2>

				<p> Fees must be paid prior to commencement of a course. If students do not attend a class, the time can not be extended into another class nor is a refund available.</p>
